        <button class="accordion">Valence</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more
                positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed,
                angry).

        <button class="accordion">Danceability</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo,
                rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.

        <button class="accordion">Energy</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic
                tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the
                scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate,
                and general entropy.

        <button class="accordion">Acousticness</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
            A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is
            acoustic.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <button class="accordion">Liveness</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the
                track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <button class="accordion">Speechiness</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk
                show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably
                made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech,
                either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and
                other non-speech-like tracks.
