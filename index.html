                   This is a data visualization of some audio features that every track on Spotify has. 
                   The significance of this data is that Spotify uses this raw audio data in multiple ways.
                   Spotify's recommendation system, Spotify Wrapped, and the way how Spotify generates user taste profiles come from analyzing
                   all of these audio features and more. This specific set of data focuses on the user's overall mood/taste profile.

                   To start viewing these audio features of a specific song in Spotify, 
                   enter a valid Spotify link of any Spotify track into the link textbox.
                   After clicking the Submit Link button, a graph containing those values/confidence levels on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 shall appear.
                   If you are ever confused as to what one of these audio features represent/mean, 
                   take a look at the Audio Features Definitions column. 
                   When you click on the respective name of that audio feature, you will be provided with descriptions of how Spotify accesses these features in their database.

        <button class="accordion">Valence</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more
                positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed,
                angry).

        <button class="accordion">Danceability</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo,
                rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
            </p>

        <button class="accordion">Energy</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic
                tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the
                scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate,
                and general entropy.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <button class="accordion">Acousticness</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
            A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is
            acoustic.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <button class="accordion">Liveness</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the
                track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <button class="accordion">Speechiness</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk
                show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably
                made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech,
                either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and
                other non-speech-like tracks.
